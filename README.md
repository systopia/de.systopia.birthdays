# Birthday Report

This is a simple CiviCRM report giving you a list of the upcoming birthdays of
your contacts. Simply install the extension, create a new report, and use
"Available for Dashboard" to give you the list upon login.

The extension is currently localised for English and German, but it since the
infrastructure is there, adding another language should be pretty easy. We're
also planning add more features (see
[here](https://github.com/systopia/de.systopia.birthdays/issues)), but currently
lack the funding.
